# Bar Marks - Project 1 - WDI

<p>Bar Marks is an app that allows users to preview the environment of bars all over a city before showing up, or report the mood at a bar for othe users to see. </p>

####User Stories

1. I’m Ginniffer Martiniz. I like to sip on cocktails at a bar where I can sit. I like to dance but not in an overly crowded bar. It would be awesome to find a bar close to me when I’m on the go in which I can see how the environment would be before making my way.
1. I’m Loner Lance. I rarely make public appearances and when I do, I prefer the places to be as empty as possible. Maybe one other person at the other side of the bar. It would be great to either see no mark on my go to bar, or a mark that says the bar is empty. I’m also super picky with my music. A music report would be awesome!
1. My name is Isit Fiveyet . I love HAPPY HOUR. I want to find the closest and liveliest happy hour around.
